MAKING A RELEASE

* Update plugin version numbers in searchable and searchable14 projects

* Perform full test in searchable/trunk with:

    ant

This runs the unit, functional and integration tests.

This needs to be done for at least the current production version of
Grails and preferably the one before and current development versions,
and both searchable and searchable14 projects.

There should be no failing tests and the ant build should complete.

* Update wiki docs

This can be done either by editing the docs in src/docs/wiki and
uploading them to grails.org, or by updating them on grails.org and
then downloading them to src/docs/wiki.

In particular rememeber to add something to the "Searchable Plugin -
Releases" page.

The sync-docs tool can be used for upload/download, see
tools/sync-docs/README.txt.

    groovy tools/sync-docs/scripts/get -server=www.grails.org -dir=src/doc/wiki -username=maurice -password=xxx -startPage='Searchable Plugin' -match='^Searchable Plugin.+$'

Commit wiki docs.

* Using Grails 1.1 and in searchable/trunk, run
