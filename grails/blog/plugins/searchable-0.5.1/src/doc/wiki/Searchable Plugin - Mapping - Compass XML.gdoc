h1. Compass Mapping XML

To use Compass Mapping XML, add a  @DomainClassName.cpm.xml@  file to your classpath.

Normally with Compass you need a master XML config file - typically  @compass.cfg.xml@  - in which you declare these mapped classes. With the Searchable Plugin you can choose whether you want a  @compass.cfg.xml@; if it is not found, it detects your mapping XML files automatically.

Refer to the Compass docs [from here|http://www.compass-project.org] for more.

The plugin currently configures the Compass mappings by generating this XML at runtime, so if you would like to see it, enable [debug logging|Searchable Plugin - Debugging].
