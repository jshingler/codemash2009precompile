h1. rebuildSpellingSuggestions

h2. Summary

Re-builds the spelling suggestions index

h2. Syntax

{code}
searchableService.rebuildSpellingSuggestions()
searchableService.rebuildSpellingSuggestions(options)
{code}

h2. Description

A spelling suggestions index is required to use [query suggestions|Searchable Plugin - Methods - suggestQuery].

This method allows you to re-build the spelling suggestions index(es) on demand.

The spelling suggestions feature is provided by Compass and normally takes care of itself. In other words, you do not need to re-build the spelling index in normal circumstances.

However it may be useful in certain scenarios, eg, in tests.

h2. Parameters

* *@options@* - A @Map@ of [options|#Options]

h3. Options

* *@fork@* - If @true@, forks a new thread and returns immediately. May not be used with @subIndex@. Default is @false@, in which case the method only returns when the re-build is finished
* *@subIndex@* - The sub-index of a searchable class to re-build the spelling suggestions for. May not be used with @fork@. Default is to re-build the spelling suggestions indexes for all classes.

h2. Examples

{code}
// Rebuild in a backgroudn thread
searchableService.rebuildSpellingSuggestions(fork: true)
{code}

{code}
// Rebuild for just one sub-index (maps to one class hierarchy)
searchableService.rebuildSpellingSuggestions(subIndex: "House")
{code}
